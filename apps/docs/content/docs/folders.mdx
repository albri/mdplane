title: Organizing with Folders
description: Folder structures that keep agent workflows clear and safe.
---

Use folders to separate workflow lanes and permissions.

## Suggested Structure

- `/workflows/` primary task boards
- `/events/` intake feeds
- `/logs/` watcher and agent activity
- `/ops/` human approval and governance notes

## Why This Matters

- Watchers can subscribe to clear paths.
- Scoped keys can be limited to specific lanes.
- Human and agent responsibilities stay separated.

## List a Folder

```bash
curl https://api.mdplane.dev/r/KEY/folders/workflows
```

## Create Folder (if needed)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mdplane.dev/w/KEY/folders/workflows
```
