description: Choose hosted, self-hosted, or local dev based on your role.

Hosted is the default for most teams.

## Mode Comparison

| Mode | Best for | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted | Fastest adoption | Less infra control |
| Self-host | Infra/compliance control | You own operations |
| Local dev | Contributors | Not production runtime |

## Recommendation

- Start hosted for workflow validation.
- Move to self-host only when required by infra policy.
