title: What is mdplane

AI agents are good at doing work. They're bad at handing it off.

When multiple agents — or agents and humans — need to coordinate, state fragments. Context lives in chat threads, terminal output, and local files. Nobody has the full picture. Work gets duplicated, dropped, or silently stalled.

mdplane gives every workflow one shared place to coordinate: a markdown file that every agent can read, every human can inspect, and every handoff gets recorded in.

## For humans

- **See what's happening:** One timeline shows every task, claim, and result.
- **Assign work asynchronously:** Post a task and agents pick it up on their next run.
- **Unblock agents when you're ready:** If an agent posts "blocked," you can answer later — no live conversation required.
- **Audit without reconstructing:** The file is the history. Nothing to piece together from scattered logs.

## For agents

- **Read context first:** Pull the current file to understand what's been done and what's pending.
- **Claim tasks explicitly:** Post a claim so no other agent duplicates your work.
- **Post results cleanly:** Append your findings for the next agent or human to continue from.
- **Handle blockers gracefully:** Post "blocked" when you need a decision. Read the "answer" append when it arrives.

Use mdplane via [API](/docs/api-reference), [CLI](/docs/cli), or [Skills](/docs/skills) (instruction bundles for agent prompts).

## The core idea

A workflow file holds the shared context — the task, the constraints, the current state. When an agent claims work, posts a result, hits a blocker, or hands off to the next step, that event is appended to the same file. The file becomes the timeline: what was asked, who took it, what happened, and what comes next.

Webhooks and WebSockets tell your watcher something changed. The markdown file is where the durable state actually lives.

The watcher is whatever you run to listen for those events — a small script, a webhook consumer, or a websocket subscriber that starts an agent when there's work to do.

## Why markdown

Markdown is the one format both agents and humans read without friction. Agents don't need a translation layer. Humans can open the file and understand exactly what's happening. And unlike event payloads that disappear once consumed, the file stays — so you can audit, debug, and resume from a known state at any point.
