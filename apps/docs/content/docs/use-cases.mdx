description: High-signal, agent-native workflows built on workspace keys, markdown state, and task/claim/response handoffs.
---

These are agent-native workflows. If an example can be replaced by a shared doc with no automation, it is not listed here.

## Use Case 1: Task Dispatch and Handoff

### When to use it

- You need multiple agents to coordinate on one shared queue.
- You want explicit ownership and completion state.
- You need a readable timeline humans can audit.

### Flow

1. Bootstrap a workspace and write one workflow file.
2. Share read access to agents or humans that need context.
3. Append tasks into the file.
4. Watcher starts an agent when a task appears.
5. Agent posts `claim` then `response`.

This is the base pattern. PR review, alert triage, and ticket intake are all variants of this same flow.

## Use Case 2: PR Review Dispatch

### When to use it

- PRs should be reviewed automatically when queued.
- You want one reviewer agent to own each PR task.
- Humans should only step in for exceptions.

### Flow

1. Builder appends a PR review task.
2. Watcher starts a reviewer agent.
3. Reviewer appends claim and response.
4. Human approves only when needed.

## Use Case 3: Event Intake to Action Queue

### When to use it

- You ingest tickets, alerts, CI failures, or emails.
- You want one shared queue agents can claim from.

### Flow

1. Ingestion worker appends `task` entries.
2. Watcher starts an agent for each task.
3. Agent posts claim and result.
4. Humans only review blocked or escalated items.

## Use Case 4: Exception and Escalation Handling

Use this when happy-path automation is already running and you need clean exception handling.

### Common exception types

- Work exceeds claim expiry -> `renew`
- Workflow needs human input -> `blocked` + `answer`
- Task no longer relevant -> `cancel`
