title: Data Security Model
description: What mdplane secures and what your own systems must secure.
---

## Responsibility Split

mdplane responsibility:
- stores workflow files and append history
- enforces route-level auth boundaries
- applies configured limits and validations

Your responsibility:
- watcher and agent runtime security
- prompt/input safety for one-shot runs
- secrets management in your infrastructure
- business-logic authorization rules

## Practical Boundary

mdplane is shared workflow state, not business-logic execution.
