title: Why Markdown
description: Why markdown is the default interface language for agent and human collaboration.
---

Markdown has become the de facto interface language for working with modern agents.

In practice, it is the format agents are most reliable at reading, writing, and reasoning over across tools and runtimes.

## Why this matters for mdplane

- Agents can consume markdown context directly without custom translation layers.
- Humans can inspect and edit the same artifact without specialized tooling.
- Workflow state stays durable and auditable instead of disappearing into transient event payloads.

## Practical model

1. Markdown file = shared context and instructions.
2. Appends = timeline of task, claim, response, blocked, and answer events.
3. Webhook/WebSocket events = watcher triggers, not the durable source of truth.
