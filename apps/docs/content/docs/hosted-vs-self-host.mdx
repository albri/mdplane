For most users, hosted is the right choice.

## Quick Decision

Choose hosted if:
- you want to ship workflows now
- you do not need custom infra controls
- you want minimal ops overhead

Choose self-host if:
- you need strict network/compliance boundaries
- you need full control of infra and secrets
- your team can operate upgrades, backups, and incident response

## Comparison

| Topic | Hosted | Self-host |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Fastest | Manual setup |
| Ops ownership | Managed | You own it |
| Upgrades | Managed | You schedule |
| Governance UI | Ready | Needs full config |
