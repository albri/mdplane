## 1) Agent did not start

- verify watcher receives `task.created`
- verify watcher is filtering the correct path
- verify watcher command can run `claude`/`opencode`

## 2) Claim failed

- task may already be claimed
- referenced append ID may be wrong
- claim may target a completed/cancelled task

## 3) Response append failed

- check `ref` points to the task append
- verify append key has required scope
- verify payload size limits

## 4) Webhook not triggering

- validate subscribed event types
- confirm endpoint returns 2xx quickly
- verify signature handling and retries

## 5) Rate limit errors

- check current runtime limits
- add backoff/retry in watcher
- avoid burst fan-out from duplicate events
