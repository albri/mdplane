description: Runtime limits that affect workflows and how operators can tune them.

## Day-1 Limits to Know

- request rate limits by endpoint class
- file and append payload size caps
- claim expiry bounds
- search/query size caps

## Operator Tuning

Self-host operators can tune limits via server configuration and env vars.

Keep docs and runtime values in sync. Drift causes workflow failures and confusion.

## Practical Check

When debugging unexpected 429/400 responses:
1. verify current runtime config
2. verify docs values
3. update whichever is stale
