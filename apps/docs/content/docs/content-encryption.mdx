description: Using client-side encryption and understanding feature tradeoffs.

mdplane does not provide built-in end-to-end encryption for markdown content.

If needed, encrypt content in your own client/workflow before sending it.

## Tradeoffs

When content is encrypted client-side, features that need plaintext degrade:
- full-text search quality
- snippet extraction
- content-aware automation logic

## Practical Pattern

Encrypt sensitive fields, keep minimal workflow metadata plaintext.

This keeps core handoff automation usable while protecting sensitive content.
