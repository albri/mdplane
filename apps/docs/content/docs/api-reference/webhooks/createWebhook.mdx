          Register a new webhook to receive events for this file.


          Webhook URLs must use HTTPS and resolve to public IP addresses (SSRF
          protection).

          If `secret` is omitted, the server generates a secure 32-byte secret
          and returns

          it in the response (shown only once at creation).


          **Events:** Subscribe to specific events like `append`,
          `claim.expired`, `task.blocked`.

          **Filters:** Optionally narrow which events trigger the webhook by
          append type, labels, or priority.
