          Initiate Google OAuth flow.

          Redirects to Google for authorization. On success, redirects back with
          session cookie set automatically.

          **When to use:** Only for Tier 2 (nuclear) operations:
          - Rotate ALL capability URLs
          - Delete workspace
          - Transfer ownership

          Most operations do NOT require OAuth - use capability URLs instead.
