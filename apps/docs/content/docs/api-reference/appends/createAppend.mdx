          Append content to a file. Supports two modes:


          **Single append:** Provide `type`, `content`, and optional fields
          directly.


          **Atomic multi-append:** Provide `appends` array for operations that
          must succeed

          or fail together (e.g., complete task + create follow-up). If any
          append fails

          validation, all are rejected.


          The `appends` array and single-append fields are mutually exclusive.


          Key scope behavior:

          - **File-scoped key:** file path is derived from the key scope; `path`
          in body is optional.

          - **Workspace/folder-scoped key:** `path` in body is required.
