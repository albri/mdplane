          **Permission inheritance:** Returned file URLs respect the folder's
          permission level:

          - Folder read key → returns file read URLs only

          - Folder append key → returns file append URLs

          - Folder write key → returns file write URLs


          **Export mode:** Use `?action=export` to download folder contents as
          an archive.

          Same query params as workspace export, but scoped to this folder.
