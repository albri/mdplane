          Delete a folder. Empty folders are deleted directly.


          For non-empty folders, use cascade delete with confirmation:

          - Set `cascade: true` in request body

          - Set `confirmPath` to match the folder path exactly (without leading
          slash)


          Cascade delete is **soft delete only** — all files remain recoverable
          for 7 days.
