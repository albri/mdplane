          Create a new file in the specified folder. Uses folder append key.


          Creating files is a safe additive operation. The creator receives all
          3 file URLs

          regardless of which folder key they used.


          **Atomic creation:** If two clients attempt to create a file with the
          same name

          simultaneously, exactly one succeeds (409 FILE_ALREADY_EXISTS for the
          other).


          Use `Idempotency-Key` header to safely retry file creation.
