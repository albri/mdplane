          Check the validity of capability URLs with extended information
          available

          when using a write key.


          Returns extended information about keys belonging to the
          file/workspace,

          including path and detailed status.


          Keys for other files return minimal response (valid/invalid only).


          **Use cases:**

          - Agent startup: "Which of my configured keys are still valid?"

          - Monitoring: "Have any of our capability URLs been rotated?"

          - File owner audit: "What keys exist for my file and what permissions
          do they have?"


          **Rate limiting:** 5 requests/min per IP.
