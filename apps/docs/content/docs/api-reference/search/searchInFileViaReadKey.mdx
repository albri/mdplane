          Search within the scope the capability URL grants access to.


          This is **lexical** full-text search (term-based), not
          semantic/embedding search.

          Results include **snippets** (relevant chunks) and highlights.


          **Deleted items are excluded**: files with `deleted_at` set are never
          returned.


          **Scoping:**

          - **File-scoped key:** Searches that file's content and its appends

          - **Folder-scoped key:** Searches file contents and appends within
          that folder scope

          - **Workspace-scoped key:** Searches file contents and appends within
          the whole workspace


          **Query semantics:**

          - `q` is treated as plain text (special operator syntax is not
          supported in v1).


          **Filters:**

          - `q`: Full-text search query

          - `type`: Filter by append type (task, claim, response, comment, etc.)

          - `status`: Filter tasks by status (pending, claimed, completed,
          cancelled)

          - `author`: Filter by author name

          - `labels`: Filter by labels (comma-separated, OR matching)

          - `priority`: Filter by priority levels

          - `since`: Return results after this timestamp
