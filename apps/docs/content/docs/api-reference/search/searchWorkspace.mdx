          Search across all files in the workspace. Requires API key
          authentication.


          This is **lexical** full-text search (term-based), not
          semantic/embedding search.

          Results include **snippets** (relevant chunks) and highlights.


          **Deleted items are excluded**: files with `deleted_at` set are never
          returned.


          Supports all the same filters as file-level search, plus:

          - `folder`: Limit search to a specific folder path


          **Frontmatter Query:** Use `frontmatter.` prefix to filter by
          frontmatter fields.

          Example: `?frontmatter.skills=security&frontmatter.status=active`
