          **⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION**


          This will:

          - Generate new read/append/write keys for all files/folders

          - Invalidate ALL existing capability URLs

          - Break all integrations using old URLs

          - Return newly generated root read/append/write keys once in the
          response


          Use this when you suspect keys have been compromised.


          **Requires:** OAuth session (GitHub/Google) and workspace ownership.
