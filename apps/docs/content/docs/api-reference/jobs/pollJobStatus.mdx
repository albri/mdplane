          Poll the status of an asynchronous job. Job poll URLs use capability
          keys

          (same format as file keys) to prevent job ID guessing.


          Jobs complete within 60 seconds or fail.


          **Job lifecycle:**

          - `pending`: Job is queued, waiting to start

          - `processing`: Job is currently running

          - `completed`: Job finished successfully, result available

          - `failed`: Job encountered an error


          Job poll URLs expire after the job completes + 1 hour.
