          Requires API key with `write` scope.


          Empty folders are deleted directly. For non-empty folders, use cascade
          delete

          with confirmation by setting `cascade: true` and `confirmPath`
          matching the

          folder path exactly.


          Cascade delete is soft delete only — all files remain recoverable for
          7 days.
