          Create a new API key for programmatic workspace access.


          **Requires:** Session cookie (verified email) and workspace ownership.


          **Key format:** API keys start with `sk_` prefix:

          - `sk_live_...` for production

          - `sk_test_...` for test environments


          **Important:** The full key is only shown once at creation time. Store
          it securely.

          Keys are hashed before storage — we cannot recover lost keys.
