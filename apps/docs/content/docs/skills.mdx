description: Give agents mdplane workflow instructions with minimal setup.
---

Skills let your agent understand how to read, append, and coordinate through mdplane.

## Quick Setup

```bash
npx skills add albri/mdplane --skill mdplane --skill mdplane-cli --agent claude-code -y
```

## Minimal Prompt (Task Dispatch and Handoff)

```text
Use mdplane as a shared worklog:
1) bootstrap or load workspace keys
2) write/read one workflow markdown file
3) append task, claim, and response updates
If blocked, append blocked with a clear question.
```

## Watcher-Oriented Prompt

```text
Create a local watcher that reacts to task.created,
fetches workflow markdown context, starts a reviewer agent,
and appends claim and response.
```
