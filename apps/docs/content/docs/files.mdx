description: File operations that support workflow state and handoffs.

Use files for durable workflow context. Use appends for execution timeline.

## Create or Update a Workflow File

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.mdplane.dev/w/KEY/workflows/pr-review-dispatch.md \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"# PR Review Dispatch\n"}'
```

## Read a Workflow File

```bash
curl https://api.mdplane.dev/r/KEY/workflows/pr-review-dispatch.md
```

## Delete a File

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.mdplane.dev/w/KEY/workflows/pr-review-dispatch.md
```

## Practical Pattern

- File body: durable instructions/context
- Appends: task, claim, response timeline
