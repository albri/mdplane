Self-hosting is for advanced operators.

## Start (Minimal Profile)

```bash
cp .env.selfhost.example .env.selfhost
pnpm run selfhost:min:up
```

## Optional Full Profile

```bash
pnpm run selfhost:full:up
```

## What You Own

- secrets management
- upgrade cadence
- backups and recovery
- observability and incident response

## Runtime vs Governance

You can run runtime URL-key workflows without full governance mode.
Enable governance only when OAuth/account controls are required.
